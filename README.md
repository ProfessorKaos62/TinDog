TinDog Starting Files

This is a website I have built with the help of Angela Yu and her Udemy course.

The main focus of this project was learning bootstrap, more advanced css techniques, code refactoring,
    and so on. This was a very fun project, and I am very proud to say that everything came pretty 
    easy with getting media query breakpoints and z-index figured out.
