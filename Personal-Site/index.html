          <h2>Hi.</h2>
          <p class="first-p">Welcome to my website. I built this with the help of Angela Yu's Udemy course on full stack web develpment. I am a car salesman by day, and a web developer by night.
            In my free time I play video games, guitar, ride motorcycles, work on my bikes and cars, and just about anything that keeps me busy. Thanks for stopping by.</p>

            <h3>Motorcycles & Chess</h3>
            <p>I am an avid motorcycle rider. I've been riding since I was 14 and have owned upwards of 20 bikes since then. Ask me about them! I'll talk your ear off. 
                Chess, on the other hand, I have only been playing for a few years consistently. I'm rated around 900 on chess.com because I don't have much time to play rapid, however,
                I'm rated about 1300 on Social Chess, which is where I play most of the time against a friend. We play multi-day-move games because neither of us have time for 10 minute matches</p>

            <h3>Drums & Guitar</h3>
            <p>Drumming is a major passion of mine, guitar is second. I've been playing guitar longer than I've been playing drums, however, I enjoy drums so much more. I have
                unfortunately never played in a band, but I have played live a few times. One, a Nirvana "Nevermind" album cover for the anniversary, and I used to play in 
                my worship band at church for years when I was a kid. I play a lot of different types of music, but <strong>mostly</strong> pop-punk and hardcore/metalcore.</p>
